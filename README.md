# CODECRAFT_ML_01

A machine learning project developed during my internship for the CODECRAFT_ML_01 challenge. This project involves training and evaluating a model using structured tabular data to make predictions.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

The notebook (`CODECRAFT_ML_01.ipynb`) walks through a complete machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (if any)
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation on validation data
- Prediction on test data

> **Note:** The notebook format makes it easy to follow along with the logic and visualize results step by step.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/padopadi/CODECRAFT_ML_01.git
   cd CODECRAFT_ML_01
2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):

       pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook:
       jupyter notebook CODECRAFT_ML_01.ipynb

4. Run all cells and follow the code and output in the notebook.


📊 Datasets
train.csv: Contains labeled data for training the model.

test.csv: Contains unlabeled data for which predictions are made.

These files are assumed to be structured with appropriate features. Modify the preprocessing steps as necessary if the schema changes.
